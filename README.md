YAMFE (Yet Another MAME Front End)

This is a very basic front end for MAME, the only thing unique about is is that it can handle multiple emulators with multiple paths in the same game list. There are many others that are far better. This can be compiled for Windows 7 and up.

Currently there is only 1 skin, one control combination and limited graphics. This is very much an alpha product from around 2016, and I am just now getting around to updating it in 2025. 

I'm posting to github mostly as a form of backup. If you can find any of this code useful, your welcome to use it in your projects.  

Requires Visual Studio 2022 and the Xaudio2, version 2.9 Microsoft.XAudio2.Redist.1.2.11 nuget package installed to build correctly.
